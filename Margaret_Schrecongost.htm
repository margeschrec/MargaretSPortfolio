            <h1>Artist-Painter</h1>
            <p>My name is Margaret Schrecongost, I am a visual artist born and raised in Buffalo Ny. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Artist Statement: I make narrative work. I recontextualize  the genere of historical narrative paintings and the female nude, by painting with reference to my own body in my figurative work. In my work, the female form transform from passive object to self portrait. I am the author, subject, and viewer.

                My collage pieces serve to create narrative, without the weight of the figure. Composing memory-like snapshots of objects, meaning becomes playful. The objects place memory against the unknown future. These anxious narratives were made in isolation. Placing fear and axiety hand in hand with humor. Using humor to temper the anxiety of the future. Tension, anxiety, humor.   </p>
